### ❔ FAQ

#### How many free domain names can be registered? 🚀  
Currently, the limit is 3. Due to the high volume of domain abuse, we are no longer reviewing applications to expand the domain registration limit. However, we may reopen the option to request limit expansions in the future. In the meantime, you can set up subdomains via your DNS panel (e.g., example.foo.us.kg).

#### Which DNS platforms can I use this domain with?  
You can use it with virtually any DNS management system! Just input the provided platform’s NS records or your own into the DigitalPlat FreeDomain panel (e.g., Try Cloudflare if you're not sure). Feeling adventurous? You can even set up your own DNS system—PowerDNS and BIND are excellent choices to get started!
